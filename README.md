# How can you help?

- add a main to exercises that are only functions
- add new exercises ([sample](https://github.com/fwuensche/42-exam-miner/pull/1/files))
- reorganize exercises in its corresponding level
- improve solutions by:
  - better naming variables and functions
  - being rather explicit then implicit (for instance, avoid one-liners)
  - catching bugs ([sample](https://github.com/fwuensche/42-exam-miner/pull/2/files))
  - proposing your own solution as an alternative ([sample](https://github.com/fwuensche/42-exam-miner/pull/3/files))

### More specifically, some actionable tasks are:

- [ ] solve ft_itoa ([here](https://github.com/fwuensche/42-exam-miner/tree/master/04/4-4-ft_itoa))
- [ ] add a main to ft_list_foreach ([here](https://github.com/fwuensche/42-exam-miner/tree/master/04/ft_list_foreach))
- [x] remove sort_int_tab duplicate file ([here](https://github.com/fwuensche/42-exam-miner/tree/master/04/4-3-sort_int_tab))
- [ ] remove check_mate duplicate file ([here](https://github.com/fwuensche/42-exam-miner/tree/master/04/4-5-check_mate))
- [ ] remove example file if it is contained in subject ([here](https://github.com/fwuensche/42-exam-miner/tree/master/04/4-1-rev_wstr))
